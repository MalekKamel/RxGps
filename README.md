#### If you tried to enable GPS before, you'll find it a complex task and encounter many problems. One of these problems is ` ResolvableApiException` which you must handle in your onActivityResult(). As a result you'll spread your logic everywhere!

# The Clean Solution
##### Using RxLocationSettingsRequest you just write few lines of code and all the work will be done for you!

```java
LocationRequest locationRequest = new ...
new RxLocationSettingsRequest()  
        .request(locationRequest, MainActivity.this) // FragmentActivity
        .subscribe(isLocationRequested -> {  
            if (isLocationRequested){  
                // Location is now enabled and you can implement your logic of  
                // location safely  
              }  
         });
```
